# 1.0 English version

With the MHD-Scanner, you can get points and play games by buying Groceries which expired just a few days ago. Thus you encourage people to buy food which isn't spoiled, but Supermarkets still dispose, because not enough people are buying it. It's a Win-Win Situation, both for the people, who can play games and for the environment.
